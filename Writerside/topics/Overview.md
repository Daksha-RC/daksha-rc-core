# Overview

Daksha-RC is designed to address the essential need for maintaining master data and actor data (such as people, entities, or objects) across digital platforms. 
For instance, a property tax system requires well-structured and validated data on properties, land boundaries, tax codes, taxpayers, and inspection officers. 
This ensures efficient management of property tax transactions, providing a seamless and reliable experience for all stakeholders.

As the world becomes data-rich, it's crucial to store information about people, entities, locations, and assets in electronic registries with Open APIs. 
This allows other applications to easily validate and use verified data. 
Especially for people and entities, electronic validation through APIs reduces the need for paper-based checks, increasing trust and lowering validation costs.

Daksha-RC is a scalable microservice that integrates easily into any system. 
It helps organizations and governments quickly create advanced electronic registries and verifiable credentials. 
With its configuration options, you can rapidly deploy registry services via open APIs. 
It also supports registry searches, manages verifiable credentials, handles user consent, and oversees attestation and verification processes.
